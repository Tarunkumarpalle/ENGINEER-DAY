         World Engineers Day, celebrated every September 15, serves to appreciate engineers and their contributions to society. Engineers are professionals who invent, design, and build complex systems, structures, and materials in order to fulfill functional objectives and deliverables, keeping in mind factors such as practicality, regulation, safety, and cost. The word ‘engineer’ is derived from the Latin words ‘ingeniare’ (which means ‘to create or generate’) and ‘ingenium’ (which means ‘cleverness’). An engineer typically would require foundational qualifications of a four-year bachelor’s degree in any of several engineering disciplines — or, in certain peculiar jurisdictions, a master’s degree in an engineering discipline with an addition of four to six years of peer-reviewed professional practice, which would then result in a thesis, and then, conclusively, a passing of engineering board examinations.

        The inventions of Thomas Savery and James Watt laid the foundation of modern mechanical engineering. The development of specialized machines, as well as the maintenance of these tools during the Industrial Revolution, gave rise to the rapid expansion of mechanical engineering in its birthplace of Britain and beyond.</p>

        The field of electrical engineering was marked and impacted by the experiments of Alessandro Volta in the 19th century. Other major contributions to the development of the discipline were the experiments of Michael Faraday, Georg Ohm, and others — as well as the groundbreaking invention of the electric motor in 1872. This field of engineering eventually became a profession late in the 19th century. Electrical engineers had built a global electric telegraph network and the first electrical engineering institutions backing this discipline were established in the United States and the United Kingdom. While it is difficult to name the first electrical engineer with certainty, it is noteworthy that Francis Ronalds was a standout individual in the field, having created the first working electric telegraph system in 1816 and documented a personal vision of the transformation of the world by electricity.
